    keyword: ACTIVATE
    description: |
      "Activate is a complicated term that appears in many effects over the
      three generations of the AoD System. At its design root, Activate is the instruction
      to take a turn. So, when you Activate a Monster, for example, you take a turn
      with that Monster; Whenever a Monster takes a turn, we say it is being “activated.”
      When a Character is activated, it takes a turn as normal: its Conditions trigger
      at the beginning of the turn, then its Triggered Abilities fire, and finally it
      takes a Movement Action and/or an Attack Action. Pets, however, have an optional
      effect: when you Activate one of them, instead of making them take a turn, you
      can Summon them. It's worth remembering: a Summoned Pet appears in an adjacent
      unoccupied space next to its Master."
  - id: activate-a-pet
    keyword: ACTIVATE A PET
    description: |
      The targeted Hero ACTIVATES one of their Pets (Move Action + Attack). If that Hero has no Pet on the board, they may spend this ACTIVATION to summon one: Take the chosen Pet’s card and place it near that Hero’s board and place that Pet's token (or model) in a Square adjacent to the Hero. Pets ACTIVATE for free once per round, immediately after their master’s turn (starting with the one in which they are summoned).

      This effect can only affect a Target in an adjacent square to the casting
      Character, regardless of the Skill's Range.
  - id: all
    keyword: ALL
    description: |
      An effect with this term means equivalent to the damage the Target
      is receiving. The effect still only applies to one Target of an attack, not both
      or more, during MULTISHOT, CLEAVE or STRIKE.

  - id: attack-twice
    keyword: ATTACK TWICE
    description: |
      This Monster attacks twice during the same turn. Each attack is resolved separately, meaning it can generate more than one Threat. Even though it attacks twice, the Monster has only one Move Action—so if its target moves out of its range by Reacting (<img src="/icons/reactions.svg" class="inline-icon" alt="Reactions">) to the first Attack, the Monster cannot perform the second one. If a Monster with this ability suffers STUN, it will attack only once. Monsters “Lock On” to their target at the beginning of their ACTIVATION, so even if the Hero targeted by the first Attack is no longer the Monster’s Primary Target for the second, it will still attack that Hero.

  - id: aura-(token)
    keyword: AURA (TOKEN)
    description: |
      As a Resolution effect, a Hero is often instructed to write down an
      Aura on their Campaign Log or Companion App. You can keep this token on your board
      as a tactile and visual reminder that you have a special effect noted there. Aura
      tokens are Reminder tokens and were introduced in Apocalypse.
  - id: available
    keyword: AVAILABLE
    description: |
      Available refers more to a game term than necessarily a Keyword. An
      Available Skill, for example, is a Skill learned by a Hero that does not have
      its slot currently occupied (either by an Action Cube, Curse Cube, or Trauma Cube).
      An Available Resolution, in turn, is a Resolution that has not yet been chosen
      in a Charged Interaction or has not been declared “unavailable” by some effect.
  - id: avoid
    keyword: AVOID
    description: |
      Avoid is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a new term in relation
      to the Corebox, so it is worth clarifying. “Avoid” is used to indicate that you
      do not suffer some effect, much as PREVENT would, but since PREVENT is a Keyword,
      the adoption of a different term is necessary.
  - id: bash
    keyword: BASH
    description: |
      Bash is a trait characteristic of the Hero Andreas. Whenever a Skill
      has Bash, at the moment you are about to resolve the effect containing the Bash
      Keyword, you may discard 2 Shield tokens. If you do, add the effect described
      between the “[]” to your Skill resolution. Otherwise, you must resolve that Skill
      without considering it a part of the effect.

    description: |
      This is a special ability that a few Monsters possess and that turns
      them into very dangerous enemies. When a Character suffers BLINDNESS, they must
      take a BLIND token and keep it on their board. While holding a BLIND Token, the
      Character automatically misses any weapon attack if their natural d20 roll is
      10 or lower, even if they have succeeded on their Weapon's Accuracy check. BLINDNESS
      is a Redundant Condition that lasts until the Character takes a Recall Action
      or it is removed by a CLEANSE effect.

  - id: bounty
    keyword: BOUNTY
    description: |
      Bounty replaces and updates the “LOOT” Keyword that Companions had
      in Age of Darkness. Therefore, when a Monster is defeated by an attack that has
      BOUNTY, that Monster drops a LOOT token when removed from the board (LOOT tokens
      are Ground Movable Objects that can be collected with a Minor Action; when collecting
      Loot, a Hero draws a Chest card, but does not roll the Trap Die).
  - id: brittle
    keyword: BRITTLE
    icon: "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets.drunagor.app/CampaignTracker/Keywords/brittle.png"
    description: |
      Some attacks are capable of leaving their opponents vulnerable. When
      a Character suffers Brittle, they must take a Brittle token and keep it on their
      board. If they are a Hero, Pet, or Companion of any sort, the next time they suffer
      damage from any source, they will suffer double that damage and remove their Brittle
      token (remember, suffered damage is the damage taken that was not prevented).
      If they are a Monster, the next weapon or magic attack that hits them turns into
      a Critical Hit and removes their Brittle token. Brittle lingers until it is removed
      or is triggered as described. It is a Redundant Condition.
  - id: burn
    keyword: BURN
    description: |
      BURN is a Persistent Damage Condition. When a Character suffers BURN, they take the appropriate number of tokens and place them on their board. At the start of their turn, they suffer 1 non-preventable damage for each BURN token they have, then remove 1 of those tokens. BURN is a Stackable Condition (up to 4 instances).
  - id: burn-x

      removes one of those tokens from its board. BURN is a stackable Condition.
  - id: cancel
    keyword: CANCEL
    description: |
      Cancel is a term that has come to be associated with Interruptions
      due to their ability to respond to an attack while it is being delivered, rather
      than after it has already hit its target. When an attack is Canceled, this means
      that it no longer exists and doesn’t cause damage to any of its targets anymore.
      Characters who have already used Interrupts for a Canceled attack are still considered
      to have used those abilities, but after the attack is Canceled, no other Characters
      can use an Interrupt (and of course, no Reactions) against that attack.
  - id: cast
    keyword: CAST
    description: |
      This term is used to define the moment when an effect is applied in
      the game, often related to the Character responsible for causing it. So, when
      your Hero spends one of their Action Cubes to use a Battle Focus Skill, for example,
      that Hero is casting a FOCUS 1 AND CLEANSE 1 effect.
  - id: catalyze
    keyword: CATALYZE
    description: |
      This is a Keyword designed to condense an effect into a single word,
      saving text space. When a Hero Catalyzes, it means that the next Action Cube they
      use this turn (current turn only) is treated as a Wild Cube (if it is used to
      use a Hero Skill, treat all numbers written in their numerical form as if they
      were doubled). Wild Cubes can be used as if they were any color, but it is important
      to remember that the Range for the effects of a Skill activated using a Wild Cube
      is based on its Type (i.e., a Melee Skill activated through a Wild Cube still
      has Melee Range).
  - id: cd-collateral-damage
    keyword: CD (COLLATERAL DAMAGE)
    description: |
      This effect is applied to the target of an Attack if that Attack successfully reduces their Health. Discarding SHIELD tokens does not count as reducing Health.
  - id: chain-up
    keyword: CHAIN-UP
    description: |
      Monsters with this skill specialize in capturing Heroes. At the beginning
      of their turn, immediately after suffering the effects of any Condition that might
      be affecting them, a Monster with Chain-Up targets the Strongest Hero who is not
      adjacent and within Range 1 (if there is such a Hero). That Hero suffers 2 non-preventable
      damage and is dragged to an empty square of their choice that is adjacent to the
      Monster with Chain-Up. If there is no space for them, the Hero suffers 4 non-preventable
      damage instead of 2, but they are not dragged.
  - id: channel
    keyword: CHANNEL
    description: |
      As long as a Skill with Channel has an Action Cube occupying its slot
      (not when it is blocked by a Curse Cube or Trauma Cube), the passive bonus described
      in “Channel - Effect” takes effect as if it were a Passive Skill. This benefit
      is also applied to the very Skill that generated it. It lasts until this Action
      Cube is recalled.

  - id: charge
    keyword: CHARGE
    description: |
      "Some Monsters have the ability to charge their enemies to maximize
      their attacks. Whenever a Monster with this ability moves 3 or more squares in
      order to reach their target, consider the base damage value of this attack as
      if it were double. Remember: Monsters will always move the least amount of squares
      they can in order to reach their targets or seek a position on top of Darkness.
      Despite this ability, Monsters are not smart enough to take the longest way to
      reach their target and receive this bonus. Their behavior remains the same: they
      move as few squares as possible to the target unless they can finish the movement
      upon Darkness or can avoid harmful terrain while doing so. Darkness damage boost,
      as well as damage reducers like Intimidate, are counted after this base value
      has been determined."
  - id: charm
    keyword: CHARM
    description: |
      "By enchanting the simple-mindedness of a Creature of Darkness, a Hero
      can force it to attack its own allies. When a Monster is Charmed, the player who
      bewitched it immediately activates that Monster and controls its turn. In this
      way, you can force it to attack its own allies, move through harmful terrain,
      or position them in a disadvantageous or inefficient way. However, while fighting
      to keep control of its own mind, a Monster is weaker: its attack deals only half
      (round up) of the damage it would normally (collateral damage is applied as normal).
      Darkness damage boost, as well as damage reducers like Intimidate, are counted
      after this base value has been determined."
  - id: claim
    keyword: CLAIM
    description: |
      Claim is a typical Warlord effect, representing their ability to coordinate
      the assaults of their allies. When a Hero uses Claim, they place (or replace)
      the Banner on an empty square that is adjacent to them. While under the influence
      of a Banner, as a Minor Action, a Hero may discard an INSPIRATION token to make
      a Weapon Attack of +0 HIT. For rules purposes, all squares that are adjacent to
      a Banner are considered “Under the Banner”. Finally, Banners are Movable Solid
      Objects considered Furniture and, therefore, can be crushed by Large Monsters
      and cause 2 DMG AND BLEED 2 if they are thrown at a Character.

      Monsters that target the Closest Hero as their Primary Target seek the Hero who is physically nearest to them. Monsters that attack Multiple Targets or areas still prioritize hitting as many Heroes as possible, but always choose the Closest ones among the combinations they can reach. If one of these Monsters has the option to hit the second-Closest Hero along with another Hero or Pet instead of hitting only the Closest Hero, it prioritizes the former scenario. If two or more Heroes are at the same distance from a Monster, the one who acts first on the Initiative Track is considered the Closest Hero among them.

      a “Command” effect or vice-versa. For them, these effects act independently. Other
      than this detail, Draugrs follow the same rules as a Pet when it comes to their

  - id: command-a-pet
    keyword: COMMAND A PET
    description: |
      Command a Pet is an effect similar to Activate a Pet, with the restriction
      that it can never be used to invoke a Pet on the board. So, when you Command a
      Pet you have summoned, you must choose a Pet that is already on the board and
      that is affiliated with you to Activate. An activation through this effect consists
      of a Move Action followed by a normal Attack Action. Similarly, any Conditions
      that this Pet has at the time it is activated are triggered. If another effect
      that allows you to summon a Pet on the board is triggered at the same time you

      new target of that attack. Any Prevent effect that comes with a Cover effect is
      also redirected to the new target of that attack. If an attack is targeting you

    description: |
      Idols are figures that possess magical properties which Heroes are

      or repositions (if that Idol is already on the board) its matching token on the
      center intersection of the area (blue square) they are in or in an area adjacent
      to it. Take note that just Invoking an Idol does not activate its effects immediately
      (Shamans have a class ability that allows them to do this as a special power).
      Once placed, the Idol is considered an Immovable Ground Object, meaning that it
      can’t be moved by any means, including Telekinesis. Each Idol has a power that
      can be Evoked by any Hero (not only the casting one) within Range 1 of that Idol

      This is the term used to designate an effect (usually Conditions) applied

      to defend themselves, similar to what non-preventable damage would do. Thus, an
      Inflicted effect does not generate any Attack or Threat (even if it comes from
      an Attack card, for example), not allowing Characters to use their Interrupts
      and Reactions to defend themselves. Remember, if a Character is immune to a Condition,

      won't be able to target, or be targeted, by other Characters with any attack or
      effect. - Monsters know that the Heroes are there. However, they must destroy
      the barrel before attacking them. Thus, when a Monster attacks a character inside
      the barrel, PREVENT all damage that this attack would cause and remove the barrel
      from the board. Reposition the Hero's model (the one that was hidden) in the square
      where the barrel was. - If a Large Monster steps on a barrel with a hidden

      it removes all INTIMIDATE tokens they are holding. INTIMIDATE is a stackable Condition.
  - id: interrupt

    description: |
      This Skill can only be used in response to a Character being targeted
      by an Attack, but before the targeted Character spends SHIELD tokens and a threat
      is generated. Thus, Interrupts are “faster” than Reactions. When using an Interrupt,
      a Character will not be able to use a Reaction against any threats generated by
      the attack they have interrupted, as if they had already “reacted” to that attack.
      Interrupts, also, cannot target attacks that deal non-preventable damage, and
      they are not considered Reactions for triggering abilities such as **Caltrops**,
      for example. A Hero can take only one Interruption per attack, regardless of how

  - id: killing-blow
    keyword: KILLING BLOW
    description: |
      Killing Blow is not necessarily a Keyword, but it is a term worth clarifying.
      The Killing Blow is the attack (and in this case it is necessarily an attack,
      Condition damage doesn't count, for example) that is responsible for defeating
      the Monster. If an effect Slays a Character, naturally, it also delivers the Killing
      Blow, since the term Slay specifies that it defeats the Character even though
      it doesn't reduce its Health to 0. **NOTE:** For a Monster to be defeated, it
      must be removed from the board. If an effect reduces a Monster's Health to zero,
      but does not cause it to be removed from the board (as happens if Special Mechanic
      - Shared Lifeline is in progress, for example), the attack is not considered a
      Killing Blow.

      KNOCK DOWN is a Debilitating Condition. When a Character suffers KNOCK DOWN, they take the appropriate token and place it on their board. At the start of their next turn, they discard the KNOCK DOWN token and lose their Move Action for that turn. Heroes may still take additional Move Actions following the proper rules, but Monsters will only be able to attack (if there is a Hero within range). KNOCK DOWN is a Redundant Condition (only 1 instance at a time).

    keyword: LEARN
    description: |
      During the Campaign, the terms used to represent your Hero's progression
      by acquiring a new Skill or Class Ability was “Learns and Unlocks”. From now on,
      this term has been simplified to just “Learn”, but its purpose is the same. So,
      when your Hero learns a Hero or Role Skill Level 1, they must choose a Level 1
      Skill from their Hero or Role, take its respective card and Action Cube, and add
      them to their Hero Board. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** It is important to remember that
      a Hero cannot Learn a Hero or Role Skill of Level 2 if they have not learned a
      Level 1 Skill belonging to that same Skill Tree or Dungeon Role, as already mentioned
      in the Corebox Rulebook. When a Hero learns a Class Ability, they take the matching
      card—if it is the Level 1 Ability for that Class Tree—and a White Cube. They place
      the card beside their board and the cube on the appropriate space to mark the
      Class Ability they have learned. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** Likewise, it is important
      to remember that a Hero cannot Learn a Class Ability of Level 2 or 3 if they have
      not learned a Class Ability of Level 1 or 2 (respectively) belonging to that same
      Class Tree.

They always ACTIVATE immediately after their master’s turn, before the marker moves to the next card on the track. When a Pet activates while already on the board, it takes a Move Action (it may choose to move 0 squares) then performs an Attack. Pets deal the Damage shown on their card directly. They do not need to make Accuracy Tests. Monsters only target Pets when they are unable to attack a Hero. Pets have only 1 Health Point but may receive SHIELD tokens and PREVENT effects as normal. When a Pet dies, it is dismissed. Remove its model from the board. It may be summoned again later.

      steps. However, do not worry: once one understands the concept of this effect,
      such steps become intuitive! When a Character suffers Polymorph, you must replace
      their model with a capybara, facing the direction of your choice, and give them
      a Polymorph Condition token. Take note that the direction these Characters face
      is important: When manipulating these Characters again, do not change their facing

      Character simply can’t take actions during their turn. Instead, at the beginning
      of each of their activations, they must roll the d20 to see what happens that
      turn: - If they roll 11+, they break free from the Polymorph, but do not
      act this turn. - Otherwise, if they roll 10-, they remain Polymorphed.

      Necromancer who summoned it. Unlike other Pets, Draugrs cannot be “Raised” through
      a “Command” effect or vice-versa. Likewise, the generic effect of “Activate a
      Pet of your choice” doesn’t work to Raise or Command them. Only the specific effects
      of Raise a Draugr and Command a Draugr affect these creatures. Other than this
      detail, Draugrs follow the same rules as Pets when it comes to their turns and
      other rules purposes. If all four Draugrs are already on the board, a Necromancer
      can no longer Raise them, only Command them (note that unlike other Pets, an effect
      that allows you to Raise a Draugr does not allow you to Command a Draugr—these
      are separate effects for the Necromancer). **NOTE:** Draugrs that are
      raised during the Draugrs turn (the one the Pets have after their masters turn)

      from)* a Skill you have and choose another in its place *(remember, when Relearning

  - id: resolved
    keyword: RESOLVED
    description: |
      "“Resolved” is the term used to denote the end of some game situation.
      So, when it is mentioned with an effect, it means right after that effect is applied.
      For example, analyze the following statement about a basic rule regarding Collateral
      damage: *“Collateral effects are applied after the damage is resolved.”*
      So, if a character Reacts with a Tumble Skill against a Shadow Knight’s attack,
      they will move before being Knocked Down, since the Tumble Skill (and its Jump
      2) must be fully resolved before any Collateral damage applies (if it is applied
      at all). This term can also be found referring to an Interaction or Resolution.
      When this is the case, you should know which of these two elements it is connected
      to. This is the key to understanding its meaning. *“Until Interaction...
      is resolved”* means that the Interaction must be done in full; that is, until
      the Interaction token is removed from the board. This might be because it has
      run out of charges or an effect has stipulated that it should be removed before
      that. The sentence *“...this Resolution is resolved”* only applies to
      the Resolution you are reading at that moment. Even if a Resolution is abruptly
      resolved by its own command, it will still remove 1 charge from the Interaction
      token (unless it is a Recurring Interaction or the effect itself specifies otherwise,
      of course)."

      Characters with the Restrain ability are armed with natural or artificial

      cannot leave the space they occupy as long as they hold it. A Character may discard
      their Restrain token when there are no more enemies with the ability to Restrain
      them within Range 1. Restrain is a redundant Condition. **NOTE:** Characters
      who are Restrained are able to leave their space through a Swap effect. When this
      is the case, the Object swapping with the Restrained Character takes its Restrain
      token. If this target is not a Character, the Restrain effect ends.

      clarifying. Suffer is used to define something that “hits” a Character after they
      have tried to protect themselves against it. So, “suffer damage” means to lose
      Health due to damage after you tried (if you could, naturally) to mitigate it
      through Prevent, Shield tokens, and so on.

    keyword: SURGE
    description: |
      When you Attack, if the D20 roll results in a Natural 16 or higher, the described effect is triggered. Apply this effect before Damage is dealt to the target. “Natural” refers to the value rolled on the D20, ignoring any bonuses or penalties.

    keyword: SWAP
    description: |
      When two models SWAP, they exchange their positions on the board. Models swapped in this way “step into” their new positions.
  - id: swarm
    keyword: SWARM
    description: |
      Swarm Monsters are tiny creatures that, joined together, form a single
      being, and thus they have no vital points in their body. Such creatures suffer
      only half damage (rounded up, after Prevent reductions have been applied) of all
      Weapon Attack that hit them. **Example:** *If Lorelai has 2 Intimidate
      tokens when she attacks a Monster that has Swarm and 1 Shield token using a 6-damage
      attack, that Monster would suffer only 2 points of damage in the end (6 - 2 -
      1 = 3; 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5, which is then rounded up to 2).*
  - id: take
    keyword: TAKE
    description: |
      Take is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a term that is worth
      clarifying. Take is used to describe something that is given to a Character. Whenever
      that is damage, they have the opportunity to mitigate it through Shield tokens
      or Prevent effects (unless, of course, the damage is non-preventable). If it is
      a Condition (such as Bleed) or an Effect (such as Telekinesis), that Character
      can’t use Reactions or Interrupts to avoid it, but if they are Immune to the said
      effects, they simply won't take them. Taking a Curse Cube, on the other hand,
      is different from suffering Curse and thus, this effect can't be avoided even
      if the Character is Immune to Curse.
  - id: telekinesis
    keyword: TELEKINESIS
    description: |
      Move the targeted model freely across the board. It may pass through (but not stop on) squares occupied by Solid Objects and Enemies as if it were moving with JUMP. Additionally, it does not “step into” any squares it passes over—only the one where this effect ends.
  - id: telekinesis-x
    keyword: TELEKINESIS X
    description: |
      Move any small-sized object (including small Darkness tiles) or SOLID
      OBJECTS (except Interactions) up to X SQUARES. Target is affected by harmful terrain
      or Darkness landed on including FALLING DAMAGE.
  - id: threat
    keyword: THREAT
    description: |
      Threat is the term used to define the moment when a Hero can have their
      Health points reduced by some attack or effect, but is able to defend themselves
      and try to prevent this from happening.Thus, Threat essentially defines
      when a Hero can usea Reaction in-game. As a rule, Heroes can use such Skills or
      Abilities whenever a Hero (either themselves or an ally) is threatened, that is,
      when they take preventable damage (non-preventable damage never generates a Threat).Take
      note that Threat is just a term, it doesn't change any rules. Therefore, Reactions
      with “SELF” can only be used if the casting Character is also being threatened
      and so on, as described on page 14 of the Corebox Rulebook.

      "Bookshelves are too heavy to be thrown at a Character with a Minor
      Action. Instead, it is simply knocked over, affecting a Character that is adjacent
      to it (chosen by the Hero who used the Throw Furniture Minor Action). TELEKINESIS,
      on the other hand, can throw a bookshelf normally. - Regardless of the
      way it was thrown, a bookshelf deals 2 DMG and inflicts STUN to its target (Don’t
      forget: Thrown Furniture is always broken and removed from the board.)"

    keyword: THROW (PILE OF CRATES)
    description: |
      When thrown, the Pile of Crate inflicts BRITTLE to its target if it

      crates don't even bother them. (Don't forget, thrown Furniture is broken and removed
      from the board.)
  - id: throw-(stack-of-barrels)
    keyword: THROW (STACK OF BARRELS)
    description: |
      When thrown at a Character, a barrel deals 2 DMG and inflicts KNOCK
      DOWN to its target if it is a Small Character. Large Monsters bodies are so powerful
      that barrels don't even bother them. - However, if a Hero was hidden
      inside the barrel, the throwing causes +2 DMG and it can even target Large Monsters
      and inflict KNOCK DOWN to them (overcoming their immunity thanks to the extra
      weight). - Reposition the Hero that was in the barrel in a square of their
      choice that is adjacent to the target against which the barrel was thrown. *(Don't
      forget, thrown Furniture is broken and removed from the board).*
  - id: throw-(stone-fountains)

    description: |
      Stone Fountains are attached to the ground and therefore cannot be

      Monsters who end their movement by stepping on them).*
  - id: throw-(stone-pillar)
    keyword: THROW (STONE PILLAR)
    description: |
      Stone Pillars are attached to the floor and ceiling and therefore cannot
      be thrown at other characters in any way. However, it is precisely because they
      are so firm that the opposite becomes true:- When a Character is thrown
      against a stone pillar (by effects like TELEKINESIS or PUSH), they suffer 4 non-preventable
      damage and are repositioned in a square adjacent to the pillar chosen by the Character
      who threw them. The pillar is not removed from the board.
  - id: trample
    keyword: TRAMPLE
    description: |
      TRAMPLE is an enhancement to the MOVE effect. Movements using TRAMPLE may pass through (but not stop on) squares occupied by Enemies.

  - id: turn
    keyword: TURN
    description: |
      Turn is the term used to designate the time window in which a Character
      or a card on the Initiative Track may act. Even though a Monster type has only
      one card in the Initiative Track to represent all units of that type, each Monster’s
      turn is taken individually. Therefore, the turn of a Shadow Knight with a pink
      snap-on base is different from the turn of a Shadow Knight with the green snap-on
      base. This distinction is important, because effects that can be used once per
      turn can be used once during the turn of each of these Shadow Knights, for example.
  - id: two-handed
    keyword: TWO-HANDED
    description: |
      Weapons that require both Hands to be wielded have this property. Heroes cannot equip Off-Hand Tools while wielding these Weapons. Additionally, whenever they receive an effect that instructs them to perform a <img src="/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg" class="inline-icon" alt="Melee Damage">, those Heroes may only perform one <img src="/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg" class="inline-icon" alt="Melee Damage"> from that effect (e.g., Twin Strike). Heroes wielding Two-Handed Weapons can still perform more than one <img src="/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg" class="inline-icon" alt="Melee Damage"> per turn, as long as they are from separate Actions. Whenever a Hero equips a Two-Handed Weapon, they must store any Off-Hand Tool they were holding in their bag. If their bag is full, they must choose 1 item to discard without applying its effects.
  - id: unavailable
    keyword: UNAVAILABLE
    description: |
      This is a game term usually associated with Interactions. When an effect
      states that a Resolution becomes unavailable, it means that Heroes cannot choose
      that Resolution anymore. Whenever a Hero chooses a Resolution from a Charged Interaction,
      for example, it becomes unavailable and cannot be chosen again during this Adventure.

      Pets with this trait have a lying life, needing necrotic power to stay
      upright. At the beginning of their master’s turn, they will be dismissed. At this
      point, the Necromancer may choose to take a Curse Cube to extend the Unlife of
      such a Pet for one turn—This is called “Taint”. They may choose for each Pet with
      this trait whether or not to do so, paying the Taint cost for each one individually.
  - id: versatile
    keyword: VERSATILE
    description: |
      Equipment with this property can be wielded in two different ways. When the Hero equips one of these cards, they choose one of its sides—Front or Back—to use. From then on, at the beginning of each of their following turns, they may choose to flip the card to the other side. This choice must be made before any other effect is triggered at the start of that Hero’s turn. If the side that has just been flipped face up has a "beginning of turn" effect, it will trigger as normal during that turn.

  - id: voodoo
    keyword: VOODOO
    description: |
      When a Monster has this ability, it is able to remove its Stackable
      Conditions by inflicting them back against the Heroes. Thus, at the beginning
      of these Monsters turn, when they are to be affected by Stackable Conditions *(Burn,
      Bleed, and Intimidate are examples of Stackable Conditions)*, if any of its enemies
      (Hero, Pet, Companion etc.) are within Range 1 of that Monster, instead of it
      undergoing such effects, move them to the strongest enemy among them. If the Monster
      cannot redirect such tokens, only then does it suffers such effects.

      Also, Wardens can use such Skills when Characters adjacent to them are attacked
      or threatened (if the Skill you are using is either an Interrupt or a Reaction,
      respectively) instead of using them only when they are attacked or threatened
      themselves.

      their Curse Cubes as if they were Action Cubes, and when they spend them, these
      are treated as Wild Cubes. Once spent, these cubes become conventional Curse Cubes
      again, and are removed only through Cleanse effects.
  - id: weakest

    description: |
      Monsters that target the Weakest Hero as their Primary Target seek the Hero with the lowest current Health Points. Monsters that attack Multiple Targets or areas still prioritize hitting as many Heroes as possible, but always choose the Weakest ones among the combinations they can reach. If one of these Monsters has the option to hit the second-Weakest Hero along with another Hero or Pet instead of hitting only the Weakest Hero, it prioritizes the former scenario. If two or more Heroes have the same amount of Health Points, the one who acts last on the Initiative Track is considered the Weakest Hero among them.

  - id: weapon-attack
    keyword: WEAPON ATTACK

      The Hero must make an Accuracy Test by rolling a D20 and adding their To Hit bonuses. Add the bonuses granted by the <img src="/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg" class="inline-icon" alt="Melee Damage"> instruction to any passive bonuses from Equipment, Hero Skills, and Class Abilities they have. If the roll equals or exceeds the Weapon’s Accuracy value (blue diamond), the attack hits and deals damage, including any applicable damage bonuses. If the roll is a natural 20, it’s a Critical Hit—double the attack’s damage. If it’s a natural 1, it’s a Critical Miss—the attack fails regardless of bonuses. Attacks are only made when instructed, there is no default “Attack” Action. Heroes who are not wielding a Weapon cannot make Weapon Attacks. If an effect instructs you to make two or more Attacks, resolve them one at a time, choosing each target as you make that specific Attack.
