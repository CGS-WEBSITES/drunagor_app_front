    <h3 class="headline">LOADING YOUR GAME</h3>
    <p>
      We’re glad to have you back, dear Adventurers! These instructions will
      help you restart the Campaign exactly where you left off. To do so, make
      sure all Trays, Maps, and Doors of the Adventure are already set up in
      their respective places. Then, open the “Campaign Log” tab in your
      Chronicles of Drunagor App, check which Heroes are in your Party, and
      gather the appropriate components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Model, Hero Board, Initiative card, Hero Skill cards, and Class Ability
        cards for each Hero in your Party.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is a record of Runes on the Initiative Track, draw the
        indicated number of Runes and place them back on the Track.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there are any Rune, Game State Check-Up, and/or Game Mechanics cards,
        place them in the appropriate positions on the Initiative Track. All of
        them go at the bottom end of the Track, in the Rune Slot, except for the
        Monster Raid Game Mechanic card, which goes on top of this same Slot.
        The correct order is:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="ml-4">
      <li>
        Game Mechanics go on top of Rune cards, which in turn go on top of Game
        State Check-Up cards.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, one by one, check the Game State of each Hero and make the
      appropriate adjustments. Start by clicking the “Manage Resources” button
      and assign the following components to each Hero:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Number of SHIELDS, FOCUS, KI, FURY, FRUIT OF LIFE, and any other tokens
        defined as Resources.
      </li>
      <li>Which Consumable Items (if any) are in the Hero’s Backpack.</li>
      <li>
        Which Equipment the Hero is wielding in each of their equipment slots.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, click the “Hero Skills and Class Skills” button and assign each Hero
      the Abilities they’ve learned in previous sessions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which Dungeon Role the Hero is fulfilling.</li>
      <li>Which Level 1 Skills the Hero has.</li>
      <li>Which Level 2 Skills the Hero has.</li>
      <li>Which Class Abilities the Hero has.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, adjust each Hero’s Game State as recorded in the Campaign Log:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How many Available Action Cubes the Hero has. Check their Initiative
        card to see their starting amount, then give them the appropriate Cubes
        based on the Hero Skills they’ve learned.
      </li>
      <li>
        How many Action Cubes are allocated to Skills or Expended. You may place
        all of them in the Expended Cube Box. Heroes resume the game with all
        Hero Skills unassigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        How many Curse and Trauma Cubes the Hero has. Curse Cubes or Trauma
        Cubes can be placed in any Hero or Role Skill. No need to repeat those
        selected in the previous session.
      </li>
      <li>Hero’s current Health.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once all Hero information is set, place them back on the board. Each Hero
      may reposition their Model to a space within Range 1 of the Door listed as
      “Next Door” in their Campaign Log. At least one Hero, however, must be
      adjacent to it to open it. Open that Door, build its Setup, return the
      Initiative marker to the first card on the Track, and that’s it! Resume
      the game!
