A turn is the moment when a Character takes Actions. The round is completed when the last Character on the board finishes their Actions.

Whenever a new type of Action becomes available to the Heroes, it will come with a complementary set of instructions much like the following.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – MOVE ACTION</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">The Move Action is the basic way Heroes move in CoD. It grants 3 movement points that can be used to move around the board.</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Each square moved into costs 1 movement point.</li><li>Diagonal movement is allowed and does not cost additional points.</li><li>Movement up or down board levels does not cost additional points, as long as the change is only one level for each square moved.</li><li>Heroes can travel through (but not stop in) squares occupied by their allies. They cannot travel through those occupied by enemies, though.</li><li>Heroes do not need to use all their movement points.</li><li>If a Hero is moving and decides to take a Cube Action while they still have movement points to spend, those points are lost.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">If a Hero wants to take another Move Action in the same turn, they may use a Cube Action to do so: They discard 1 Action Cube from their Pool to take an additional Move Action with 3 movement points, placing the discarded Cube in their “Expended Cubes Box” on their Hero board.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – CUBE ACTION</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">“Cube Action” is the name given to any Action where a Hero uses an Action Cube during their turn. Usually, this is to perform one of their Skills. To take a Cube Action, the Hero must spend a Cube of the appropriate color, placing it in the slot corresponding to the Skill they are using. Here are some details about these actions:</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>A Hero can only take Cube Actions during their own turn.</li><li>The type (color) of the Cube determines the Range for all effects of that Skill:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>Melee (yellow): Targets Characters adjacent to the Hero.</li><li>Ranged (red): Targets Characters within Range 1, that is, in any square in the same area (blue square) or in an area adjacent to the one the Hero is in.</li><li>Agility (green) or Wisdom (blue): Targets Characters anywhere on the board.</li></ul></li><li>A Hero is always within Range of any effects they cast themselves.</li><li>Once an Action Cube is used, it remains slotted into the socket of the Skill it was used to trigger until it is Recalled through a process we’ll cover later, the Recall Action.</li><li>A Skill is read from left to right, paying attention to the punctuation marks:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>The first term, followed by a colon (:), indicates the type of Targets that Skill can be used on. “SELF: SHIELD 2” – The allowed target for this effect is SELF, the Hero using this Skill.</li><li>Comma (,) and AND: These are used as in grammar, uniting the Keywords of a single effect. “SELF: MAKE A <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\"> OF +3 TO HIT, KEEN, AND +2 DMG” – This Attack has 3 Keywords: +3 TO HIT, KEEN, and +2 DMG.</li><li>Semicolon (;): Separates two different effects of the same Skill. “SELF: SHIELD 2; ANY TARGET: 2 <img src=\"/icons/1-spell-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Spell Damage\"> DMG” – This Skill has two effects. The first of these grants SHIELD 2 to the Hero using it. The second, in turn, deals 2 <img src=\"/icons/1-spell-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Spell Damage\"> DMG to any Target within Range.</li></ul></li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Cube Actions are the main abilities that Heroes use, and the effects of each Keyword can be found in the Summary. For this Tutorial, each Hero has the ones they use most explained on their Hero Boards.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – MAKING WEAPON ATTACKS</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">There is no basic action to Attack in CoD. Attacks are effects provided by Skills and Abilities that the Hero casts, just like any other effect.</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Weapon Attack instructions follow the pattern “MAKE A <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\"> OF +X TO HIT”, followed by any other Keywords that apply to that Attack.</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>The type (color) of the Cube used to trigger the Skill that includes the Attack determines its Range:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>Melee (yellow): The Attack can hit enemies adjacent to the Hero.</li><li>Ranged (red): The Attack can hit enemies that are in the same area (blue square) the Hero is in or the area adjacent to it. Heroes who are adjacent to enemies, however, cannot make Ranged (red) <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\">. This is called “Combat Engagement”.</li></ul></li><li>The player rolls the D20 and adds any TO HIT bonuses (+X TO HIT). If the Roll equals or exceeds their Weapon’s Accuracy value (in the blue diamond), the Attack hits and causes the damage indicated on that Weapon card, plus any damage bonuses the Attack has.<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>If the Roll is a “natural” 20 (value rolled before any modifiers), the Attack is a Critical Hit—It deals double damage.</li><li>If the Roll is a “natural” 1, the Attack is a Critical Failure—They miss even if the To Hit bonus would be enough to hit.</li></ul></li><li>Attacks made by a Hero who is on a board level above their Target gain a +2 TO HIT bonus, while those made from below the Target receive a -2 TO HIT penalty.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Once these steps are completed, the Attack is complete.</div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://druna-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/008.png\" alt=\"Vorn's weapon and Arcing Strike skill example\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">Vorn is Attacking through his Arcing Strike Skill. Since Vorn’s Dwarven Warhammer has Accuracy 7 and his Skill provides a +3 TO HIT bonus, he must score at least a 4 on the D20 for the Attack to hit and deal damage.</p></div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">STARTGAME TRIGGER</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\"><strong>Now that you’ve completed the first Tutorial readings, place the Initiative Marker on Vorn’s (or the Hero who is playing the Defender role if it is not Vorn) Initiative card.</strong> That Hero can move to reach a Monster and make Attacks (<img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\">) against it. For purposes of this Tutorial, if the Vampire is killed, keep it on the board with 1 Health so as not to interfere with the following Tutorials. <strong>Once the Defender’s turn ends (after taking their Move Action and Two Cube Actions), move the Initiative marker to the next card, the Vampire Monster, and read “The Monsters’ Turn” and “Reactions” in the Tutorial tab of your app.</strong></div><p style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\"><strong>You may begin to play the Adventure.</strong></p></div>"
