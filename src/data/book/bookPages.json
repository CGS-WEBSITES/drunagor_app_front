Blackriver, a county of the Kingdom of Elan, has been suffering from macabre events, beginning with the kidnapping of villagers under the cover of night. People are frightened, and monstrous silhouettes wander in the darkness, gnashing teeth and claws.</p><p>You arrived late, from far away. In the twilight gloom, wherever you look, there is only desolation and bloodstains painting the walls and alleys red. There’s no sign of your contractor. Or of any living soul, really. Those who remain have locked themselves inside their homes, praying for a miracle.</p><p>There is no mystery here: All tracks lead to the Count’s fortress, and whatever is happening there must be what you were hired to stop. Or rather, to fight.</p><p>The hair on your arms stands on end—it’s unmistakable...</p></div><div style=\"font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;\"><p>Blackriver needs your help.

When Monsters are spawned on the board, the matching card must immediately be placed on the Initiative Track. Monster cards are always placed in the matching Rune slots, either above or below them according to the arrow shown on the card.</p><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/003.png\" alt=\"Vampire card highlighted and on track\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">This is where the Vampire card goes on the Initiative Track.</p></div><p>As you place the Monsters in their indicated positions, attach a colored base to each. The bases match the colors on the Monster Status board. It is easiest if you follow the order shown, starting with the yellow one.</p><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/004.png\" alt=\"Placing base on monster and moving to board\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">Starting with the yellow base, the others should be blue, pink, and then green for the first 4 Monsters.</p></div><p>Mark the Health Points of each Monster on the Monster Status board with a white cube. Their initial (and maximum) value is indicated on their cards.</p><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/005.png\" alt=\"Monster card and health being adjusted\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">Use the white cubes to track each Monster’s Health on the Monster Status board.

You can access these entries in the Tutorial tab of your app whenever you want. To make your early gameplay experience easier, they are also described below.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – TURNS AND ROUNDS</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">Chronicles of Drunagor is played over a series of turns and rounds. A turn is the moment when a Character takes Actions. The round is completed when the last Character on the board finishes their Actions. The Initiative Track organizes this process.</div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/006.png\" alt=\"Initiative Track and Marker example\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">This is the Initiative Track and Marker.</p></div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>When the Initiative Marker reaches a Character’s card, it is their turn. When they finish their turn, move the marker to the next card.</li><li>After the last card on the track has been activated, the marker returns to the first card, starting the next round.</li><li>The turn order runs from left to right and from the top to the bottom of the track, as if it were a long straight line.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Place the <span style=\"color: #1E90FF;\">End of the Round</span> Game State Check-Up card at the bottom end of the Initiative Track. It serves as a reminder of some processes that take place at the end of each round.</div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/007.png\" alt=\"End of Round card placement\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">This is where the <span style=\"color: #1E90FF;\">End of the Round</span> card goes on the Initiative Track.</p></div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – HERO TURN</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">Heroes can take the following Actions during their turn, alternating between them as they choose:</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Take up to one Move Action</li><li>Take up to two Cube Actions</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Heroes are not required to take all the Actions they are entitled to.</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">We will begin by learning just these two types of Actions. Whenever a new type of Action becomes available to the Heroes, it will come with a complementary set of instructions much like the following.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – MOVE ACTION</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">The Move Action is the basic way Heroes move in CoD. It grants 3 movement points that can be used to move around the board.</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>Each square moved into costs 1 movement point.</li><li>Diagonal movement is allowed and does not cost additional points.</li><li>Movement up or down board levels does not cost additional points, as long as the change is only one level for each square moved.</li><li>Heroes can travel through (but not stop in) squares occupied by their allies. They cannot travel through those occupied by enemies, though.</li><li>Heroes do not need to use all their movement points.</li><li>If a Hero is moving and decides to take a Cube Action while they still have movement points to spend, those points are lost.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">If a Hero wants to take another Move Action in the same turn, they may use a Cube Action to do so: They discard 1 Action Cube from their Pool to take an additional Move Action with 3 movement points, placing the discarded Cube in their “Expended Cubes Box” on their Hero board.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – CUBE ACTION</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">“Cube Action” is the name given to any Action where a Hero uses an Action Cube during their turn. Usually, this is to perform one of their Skills. To take a Cube Action, the Hero must spend a Cube of the appropriate color, placing it in the slot corresponding to the Skill they are using. Here are some details about these actions:</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>A Hero can only take Cube Actions during their own turn.</li><li>The type (color) of the Cube determines the Range for all effects of that Skill:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>Melee (yellow): Targets Characters adjacent to the Hero.</li><li>Ranged (red): Targets Characters within Range 1, that is, in any square in the same area (blue square) or in an area adjacent to the one the Hero is in.</li><li>Agility (green) or Wisdom (blue): Targets Characters anywhere on the board.</li></ul></li><li>A Hero is always within Range of any effects they cast themselves.</li><li>Once an Action Cube is used, it remains slotted into the socket of the Skill it was used to trigger until it is Recalled through a process we’ll cover later, the Recall Action.</li><li>A Skill is read from left to right, paying attention to the punctuation marks:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>The first term, followed by a colon (:), indicates the type of Targets that Skill can be used on. “SELF: SHIELD 2” – The allowed target for this effect is SELF, the Hero using this Skill.</li><li>Comma (,) and AND: These are used as in grammar, uniting the Keywords of a single effect. “SELF: MAKE A <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\"> OF +3 TO HIT, KEEN, AND +2 DMG” – This Attack has 3 Keywords: +3 TO HIT, KEEN, and +2 DMG.</li><li>Semicolon (;): Separates two different effects of the same Skill. “SELF: SHIELD 2; ANY TARGET: 2 <img src=\"/icons/1-spell-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Spell Damage\"> DMG” – This Skill has two effects. The first of these grants SHIELD 2 to the Hero using it. The second, in turn, deals 2 <img src=\"/icons/1-spell-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Spell Damage\"> DMG to any Target within Range.</li></ul></li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Cube Actions are the main abilities that Heroes use, and the effects of each Keyword can be found in the Summary. For this Tutorial, each Hero has the ones they use most explained on their Hero Boards.</div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">TUTORIAL – MAKING WEAPON ATTACKS</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">There is no basic action to Attack in CoD. Attacks are effects provided by Skills and Abilities that the Hero casts, just like any other effect. Weapon Attack instructions follow the pattern “MAKE A <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\"> OF +X TO HIT”, followed by any other Keywords that apply to that Attack.</div><ul style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;\"><li>The type (color) of the Cube used to trigger the Skill that includes the Attack determines its Range:<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>Melee (yellow): The Attack can hit enemies adjacent to the Hero.</li><li>Ranged (red): The Attack can hit enemies that are in the same area (blue square) the Hero is in or the area adjacent to it. Heroes who are adjacent to enemies, however, cannot make Ranged (red) <img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\">. This is called “Combat Engagement”.</li></ul></li><li>The player rolls the D20 and adds any TO HIT bonuses (+X TO HIT). If the Roll equals or exceeds their Weapon’s Accuracy value (in the blue diamond), the Attack hits and causes the damage indicated on that Weapon card, plus any damage bonuses the Attack has.<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"><li>If the Roll is a “natural” 20 (value rolled before any modifiers), the Attack is a Critical Hit—It deals double damage.</li><li>If the Roll is a “natural” 1, the Attack is a Critical Failure—They miss even if the To Hit bonus would be enough to hit.</li></ul></li><li>Attacks made by a Hero who is on a board level above their Target gain a +2 TO HIT bonus, while those made from below the Target receive a -2 TO HIT penalty.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">Once these steps are completed, the Attack is complete.</div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\"><img src=\"https://assets.drunagor.app/book/book+wing+1+tutorial/008.png\" alt=\"Vorn's weapon and Arcing Strike skill example\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">Vorn is Attacking through his Arcing Strike Skill. Since Vorn’s Dwarven Warhammer has Accuracy 7 and his Skill provides a +3 TO HIT bonus, he must score at least a 4 on the D20 for the Attack to hit and deal damage.</p></div><div style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 4px;\">STARTGAME TRIGGER</div><div style=\"color: #1a120f;\">Now that you’ve completed the first Tutorial readings, place the Initiative Marker on Vorn’s (or the Hero who is playing the Defender role if it is not Vorn) Initiative card. That Hero can move to reach a Monster and make Attacks (<img src=\"/icons/2-melee-dmg.svg\" class=\"inline-icon\" alt=\"Melee Damage\">) against it. For purposes of this Tutorial, if the Vampire is killed, keep it on the board with 1 Health so as not to interfere with the following Tutorials. Once the Defender’s turn ends (after taking their Move Action and Two Cube Actions), move the Initiative marker to the next card, the Vampire Monster, and read “The Monsters’ Turn” and “Reactions” in the Tutorial tab of your app.</div><p style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">You may begin to play the Adventure.</p></div>"

The only word that fits this moment.</p><p>Corrupted creatures laid siege to the city from the inside out, abducting villagers night after night to sacrifice them in a ritual to a dreadful entity.

He has 25 HP for each Hero (for a total between 25 and 100).</li><li>Grab the Undead King’s Monster card, along with his 4 First Encounter Boss Attack cards, and place them with the “FRONT” side facing up in the designated slots of the Initiative Track.</li><li>Place the Undead King’s model on Map E11-F, occupying the central emerald-colored area.

Those Heroes suffer FATIGUE X, with X being the number of squares they had to move. They take 1 non-preventable damage for each AC they should discard but couldn’t.</li><li>Remove Bridge BR2-B from the board. Heroes can no longer access previous Setup areas under any circumstances. Pets on the Bridge or previous Setups are Dispelled.</li></ul><div style=\"color: #1a120f; margin-top: 1em;\">A Boss Battle is about to begin. Read the Tutorials “Boss Battles” and “Focus Abilities”.

The shadows dance as if they’ve come to life, and you find it hard to describe what unfolds before your eyes.</p><p>“Hahaha! What is this?” echoes a hoarse laugh, coming from nowhere—sounding as if it emerged from a decaying corpse. Slowly, the darkness swirls and joins together to form a monster unlike anything you’ve ever seen before: fifteen feet tall, a crown on its head, and the spine of a giant wielded like a weapon by skeletal hands. “Why resist?

If any Hero is in that area, they must reposition their model to a square adjacent to the villain.</li><li>Replace the <span style=\"color: #1E90FF;\">Hail to His Majesty</span> Scene Trigger card on the Initiative Track with the <span style=\"color: #1E90FF;\">Age of Darkness</span> card.</li><li>Finally, each Hero on a square of Bridge BR2-B or any Map from the previous Setups must move their model to a square on Map E12-F. Those Heroes suffer FATIGUE X, with X being the number of squares they had to move. They take 1 non-preventable damage for each AC they should have discarded but couldn’t.</li><li>Remove Bridge BR2-B from the board. Heroes can no longer access previous Setup areas in any way.
